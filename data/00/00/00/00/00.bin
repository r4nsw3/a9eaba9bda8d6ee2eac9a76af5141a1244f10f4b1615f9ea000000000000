    This is a game that allows players to enjoy musical pieces that are fusions of
    the classical Chinese poetry of Li Bai and Du Fu with modern music such as rock,
    ballad, and jazz.

    There are three modes, Story, in which the stories of modern and ancient China
    are intertwined, Songs, in which players can freely play pieces, and Challenge,
    in which players take on the challenge of clearing difficult requirements.

    By achieving Achievements, additional components will be unlocked.

    The musical pieces that can be chosen from will increase by clearing various
    requirements.

    There are a total of 57 pieces that can be played. Other than pieces based on
    Chinese poetry, pieces inspired by the music of the indigenous people of Taiwan
    and Japanese pieces are also available, and the content also allows more people
    to become familiar with ancient Chinese literature as an entry to learning about it.

    Summary

    A young man who dreams of succeeding in life through music suddenly slips 
    through time and space into ancient China and meets a mysterious poet.

    Please enjoy the story that is intertwined with the historical anecdotes and
    classic masterpieces of famous poets.
